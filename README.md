Heart rate synchronizes in a shared experience, especially for couples in loving relationships (Flory, 2023).
"Synchrnoization" is measured by a correlation in ECG tandem and reverse relationship in HRV.
Although mechanism is unclear, this co-regulation shows whether two people are actually in sync.
Many long-distance couples struggle with keeping attention to each other (from Quora: I don't have my girlfriend's full attention when speaking to her on the phone. It makes me uneasy. What should I do?)
Simply, active listening is not easy, and you don't know if the other person is in sync.
CyoReal won't let this happen.
