Heart rate synchronizes in a shared experience, especially for couples in loving relationships (Flory, 2023).
"Synchrnoization" is measured by a correlation in ECG tandem and reverse relationship in HRV.
Although mechanism is unclear, this co-regulation shows whether two people are actually in sync.
Many long-distance couples struggle with keeping attention to each other (from Quora: I don't have my girlfriend's full attention when speaking to her on the phone. It makes me uneasy. What should I do?)
Simply, active listening is not easy, and you don't know if the other person is in sync.
CyoReal won't let this happen.
# How
Here, we explain step-by-step about calculating correlation.
1. Obtain heart rate: there are different types of heart rate but we use Electrocardiogram (ECG) which Polar H10 collects. ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart, providing information about the heart's rhythm and rate.
2. Process heart rate
3. Calculate correlation
4. Display effects
# Interesting questions
- *Does heart rate sync over a call?* There has been evidence that shared experience in the same physical space synchronises heart rate, research on phone call has not been done much.
- Rethink digital interaction: *Does sharing physical information (heart rate) visually in increase sense of intimacy?* Digital interaction can often be dry but this is increasing. For example, my virtual interaction was 15 hours in this week, such as meeting, class, and call with my family. This is forecasted to increase, which increases well-being (Sahi, 2021). Rethinking digital interaction can boost people's mental health in the future.
